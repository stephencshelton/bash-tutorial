# Lesson: Source Script in Bash
In this exercise, you are going to learn how to source another script in Bash.
Sourcing is a method to load and execute a script in the current shell script. It's useful for reusing code and variables across different scripts.
# Requirements:
- Create a new Bash script `bash_lesson_source_script.sh`
- Create a new Bash script in the same directory as this script and name it "source_script.sh".
- The script "source_script.sh" should declare a variable 'greeting' and assign it a value of 'Hello, world!'.
- In this script, you should source "source_script.sh" and then print the value of 'greeting' variable to the terminal.
