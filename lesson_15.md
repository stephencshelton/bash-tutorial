# Lesson 10: Logical Operators in Bash
In this exercise, you are going to learn how to use logical operators in Bash.
Logical operators are used to perform operations based on one or more conditions.
# Requirements:
- Create a script called `bash_lesson_logical_operators.sh`.
- Declare two integer variables, 'a' and 'b'
- Assign any values to 'a' and 'b'
- Write an if-else statement that checks if 'a' is greater than 'b' and 'a' is less than 100 using the '&&' operator
- If the condition is true, print "a is greater than b and less than 100"
- Otherwise, print "Condition is not true"
