# Lesson: Pipes in Bash
In this exercise, you are going to learn how to use pipes in Bash.
A Pipe is a symbol used in the command line to send the output of one command to another.
# Requirements:
- Create a script called `bash_lesson_pipes.sh`.
- Create a new file named 'numbers.txt' and write numbers 1 to 5, each on a new line
- Use the 'cat' command to display the contents of 'numbers.txt'
- Pipe the output of the 'cat' command to the 'sort' command to sort the numbers in reverse order
- The final output should display numbers 5 to 1, each on a new line
